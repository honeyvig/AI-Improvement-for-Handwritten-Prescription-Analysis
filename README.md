# AI-Improvement-for-Handwritten-Prescription-Analysis
AI Improvement Specialist to enhance our existing AI system, designed to interpret handwritten laboratory prescriptions. Your role will involve refining algorithms to improve the accuracy of lab data extraction and processing. The ideal candidate will have experience in machine learning and natural language processing, with a focus on handwriting recognition.

Current State:
We have a basic workflow that reads PNG files from a designated folder, processes each image using OpenAI's GPT-4-mini, and outputs a list of labs found on the receipt. However, accuracy needs improvement.

What We Need from You:
Your task will be to enhance this workflow—either by applying techniques to improve image quality before processing or by exploring alternative AI models that may yield better results.

This is a short-term project to develop a minimum viable product (MVP), with the potential to evolve into a long-term, independent position.
We work on data-driven projects for social good and highly value candidates motivated by social and environmental impact.
---------------
To improve your existing AI system for interpreting handwritten laboratory prescriptions, we can approach the problem in two main directions:

    Improving Image Quality: Enhance the quality of the images to help the model better interpret the text.
    Improving Handwriting Recognition: Explore more advanced models or alternative techniques for handwriting recognition.

Step 1: Improving Image Quality (Preprocessing)

We can use various image processing techniques to improve the quality of the input images (e.g., removing noise, increasing contrast, binarization, and resizing).

Here is a Python script that applies common image processing techniques using OpenCV and enhances the images for better text extraction:

import cv2
import numpy as np
import os

# Path to the folder containing PNG files
input_folder = "path/to/your/folder"
output_folder = "path/to/output/folder"

# Ensure output folder exists
if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
    os.makedirs(output_folder)

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    # Load the image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)

    # Convert to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Denoising the image (Optional: Depending on the quality of images)
    denoised = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising(gray, None, 30, 7, 21)

    # Apply thresholding (binarization)
    _, binarized = cv2.threshold(denoised, 150, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)

    # Resize the image (optional, depending on your model's input size)
    resized = cv2.resize(binarized, (800, 600))  # You can modify the dimensions as needed

    return resized

def process_images(input_folder, output_folder):
    for filename in os.listdir(input_folder):
        if filename.endswith('.png'):
            image_path = os.path.join(input_folder, filename)

            # Preprocess the image
            processed_img = preprocess_image(image_path)

            # Save the processed image to output folder
            output_path = os.path.join(output_folder, filename)
            cv2.imwrite(output_path, processed_img)
            print(f"Processed: {filename}")

# Process all images in the folder
process_images(input_folder, output_folder)

Step 2: Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

We will use Tesseract OCR (open-source and widely used for text extraction) to recognize the text in the processed images. We’ll also need to integrate this step with your existing GPT-4-mini-based model.

Install Tesseract if you haven't already:

pip install pytesseract

Here is the Python code to apply Tesseract OCR on the preprocessed images to extract the text:

import pytesseract
import cv2
import os

# Path to Tesseract OCR binary (if it's not in your PATH)
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"  # Modify the path if needed

def extract_text_from_image(image_path):
    # Load the preprocessed image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)

    # Use Tesseract OCR to extract text
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, config='--psm 6')  # psm 6 is for a block of text
    return text

def process_images_for_text(input_folder):
    extracted_data = {}

    for filename in os.listdir(input_folder):
        if filename.endswith('.png'):
            image_path = os.path.join(input_folder, filename)

            # Extract text from the image
            text = extract_text_from_image(image_path)
            extracted_data[filename] = text
            print(f"Extracted text from {filename}:\n{text}")

    return extracted_data

# Process all images and extract text
extracted_data = process_images_for_text(output_folder)

Step 3: Integrating GPT-4 for Data Interpretation

You already have GPT-4-mini to process the extracted text. Now, we will integrate the extracted text with your GPT-4 mini model. The idea is to pass the OCR results to the GPT model for further processing and interpretation of the lab information.

Assuming that you have set up the GPT-4-mini API, here's how we can use it:

import openai

# Set up OpenAI API key (ensure you have a valid OpenAI API key)
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

def process_with_gpt4(text):
    # Send the text to the GPT-4 mini model for interpretation
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4-mini",
        prompt=f"Extract laboratory data from the following prescription:\n\n{text}",
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )

    # Extract and return the result
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

def interpret_extracted_data(extracted_data):
    interpreted_data = {}
    
    for filename, text in extracted_data.items():
        interpreted_text = process_with_gpt4(text)
        interpreted_data[filename] = interpreted_text
        print(f"Interpreted Data for {filename}:\n{interpreted_text}")
    
    return interpreted_data

# Process the extracted data with GPT-4 mini
interpreted_data = interpret_extracted_data(extracted_data)

Step 4: Evaluation and Model Enhancement

At this stage, you have:

    Improved image quality using preprocessing techniques.
    Text extraction with OCR using Tesseract.
    Text interpretation using GPT-4 mini to extract lab information.

To improve accuracy:

    Use specialized OCR models (like Google Vision OCR or AWS Textract) if Tesseract isn't accurate enough.
    Fine-tune GPT-4 for handwriting recognition and medical terms related to lab prescriptions (you can train GPT models on specialized datasets for handwriting and medical terms).
    Explore data augmentation: Increase the training data variety to improve model robustness.

Step 5: Optional: Using Handwriting Recognition Models

If Tesseract isn't providing sufficient accuracy, we can explore modern handwriting recognition models like CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks) or Deep Learning-based OCR.

You can also use models like EAST (Efficient and Accurate Scene Text detector) for detecting and recognizing handwriting text from the image.
Final Notes:

    Image Preprocessing: Crucial for improving OCR accuracy, especially for handwritten text.
    OCR Technology: Consider upgrading from Tesseract to commercial OCR solutions if needed.
    AI Model Improvement: Fine-tune GPT-4 or other models to improve accuracy for interpreting medical prescriptions.

This should set up a robust AI-driven system for interpreting handwritten laboratory prescriptions and outputting structured lab data.
